# ColorQuantisationinPython
The routine implemented, colorQuantize, receives an image as a matrix of these RGB values, where each value is an array of 3 integers between 0 and 255 inclusive.
I implemented a group-based color quantizer. For a given number of groups g, the range of each group will be the size of the quotient when 256 is divided by g. Any remainder is added to the range of the last group. Each value in a given group will be changed to be the integer at the middle of the range of the group (with the exception of the last range if there is a remainder). When computing the middle value of the group, round down if it is not an integer. When computing the middle value do not special case the last group, i.e. the middle value should be the same distance from the bottom of each range.
For the argument rGroups = 3, this means that all red values of pixels between 0 and 84(inclusive) will be in one group and all red values of pixels between 85 and 169 (inclusive) will bein another group and the last group with have the range between 170 and 255 (inclusive). Notice how the range from 170 to 255 is one number larger than the other ranges. For the three groups mentioned above, pixels between 0 and 84 would be converted to 42, pixels between 85 and 169 would be converted to 127, and pixels between 170 and 255 would be converted to 212.
